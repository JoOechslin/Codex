# üåå CosmicStructureSim ‚Äî A Physically Grounded Cosmological Simulation Code

**CosmicStructureSim** is a fully self-consistent cosmological simulation framework that evolves **dark matter and baryons** from the early universe (z ‚âà 100) to the present day.  
It implements **gravity**, **hydrodynamics**, and **radiative thermochemistry** to study the formation and evolution of **cosmic structures** ‚Äî including dark matter halos, gas collapse, and baryonic disk formation ‚Äî in a ŒõCDM cosmology.

## üöÄ Running the Simulation

1. **Copy all files on one directory**  
   Open the main Jupyter notebook called DFS-v11-0.ipynb. The grad_phi.cpython-312-darwin.so files as well as the 2 .npz files containing the cooling tables
   need to sit in the same directory such that the notebook finds these files.
   The .so file is compiled for a macOS environment. If you are running things on a different platform, you need to compile
   the grad_phi-v2.cpp sorce file to get your .so file.

2. **Run**  
   Open and run the DFS-v11-0.ipynb notebook. You may need to install certain modules (eg CAMB) for the notebook to run.

3. **Visualize**  
   Use the provided Python notebooks in to inspect:
   - Halo growth and temperature maps  
   - Press‚ÄìSchechter mass function  
   - Disk structure and baryonic spin evolution  
   - Layzer‚ÄìIrvine energy conservation diagnostics

## üìà Example Results

- Formation of virialized halos with realistic baryon fractions  
- Cooling-driven baryonic collapse and disk-like gas distributions  
- Evolution of temperature‚Äìdensity phase diagrams from z = 100 ‚Üí 0  
- Verified Layzer‚ÄìIrvine energy conservation throughout cosmic time
